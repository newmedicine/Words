# Four Seasons in One Day

Peculiar weather we've been having recently
We English say. A lot. 
Then feel awkward about mentioning it
Bemoaning our lack of original content

Warm rain
Windy brightness
Fresh calm
Grey into bright blue 
Wet weeds springing up on the wrong side of suburban patio borders 
Shaded lawn spluttering into life 

Willing the grass to prevail over creeping buttercup and dandelion
Dwelling on the faded patches marking the journey stops of the slide across the garden 

Trying to pull back and enjoy the still-quiet scene

Which is
Surely
The
Point
