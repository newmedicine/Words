# Marathon not a sprint

It's a marathon, not a sprint, they said
But everyone sprinted anyway.

Because that's what we always do.
The limping marathon of hospital life 
Accelerated in a slightly different direction
Scrubbed gazelles springing and leaping through the wards
I enjoyed the suspension of normal life
A chance to reflect
Released from the need to plan
(Glad I was better before it happened)

But then came the uncertainties
Will it ever end, then
Will it get me, then
Where have all the patients gone, then
The realisation that it's always been this hard
It's just a different kind of hard

The Thursday claps began to chafe
As it dawned on me that 
The uncheered twenty years before, 
and the dwindling and undefined number of years ahead
Were and will be harder than this brief sardonic respite.

And then, with newfound calm, 
Comes Acceptance, that what we do is good
And there is only really Now.
