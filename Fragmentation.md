# Fragmentation 

The tiny cogs of care
Most put in to help
Now hinder
Thrown into the groaning ill-oiled Machine of Patientry
The clever abstractions and divisions of staff and patients
Inflicted untested and unwanted
The newly incorporated Team, 
Stronger through working together 
Atomised repeatedly
The aerosol of caring dispersing in the wind
What would it feel like to be the object of our attentions, we ruminate
Our hearts reaching out to the people in front of us
But then pulling back for fear of hurt
As we know we cannot help them as we wish
And we must move on to the next one
Knowing we will never see them again as they lurch from bed to bed, nurse to nurse, doctor to doctor
Each trying to do their best
The weary Brigadier contemplates his past
And his complicity in what has happened
Feeling unable to change the system that has lost its way
